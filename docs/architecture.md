# AI Interview Screener System Architecture

## System Overview

The AI Interview Screener is a full-stack application that automates the technical interview screening process using AI. The system consists of several key components working together to provide a seamless interview experience.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Single Page Application (SPA) built with React
- Material-UI for consistent design
- TypeScript for type safety
- State management using React Context
- Real-time updates using WebSocket connections

### 2. Backend API (FastAPI)
- RESTful API built with FastAPI
- Async operations for better performance
- JWT authentication
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Structured error handling and validation

### 3. AI Integration
- OpenAI GPT-4 for:
  - Question generation from job descriptions
  - Response analysis and scoring
  - Final recommendation generation
- AWS Comprehend for sentiment analysis
- Custom prompt engineering for consistent results

### 4. Voice Processing
- Twilio for voice calls
- AWS Polly for text-to-speech
- AWS Transcribe for speech-to-text
- AWS S3 for audio storage

### 5. Data Storage
- SQL database for structured data
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features

## Data Flow

1. **Job Description Processing**
   ```
   Upload JD -> GPT-4 Analysis -> Generated Questions -> Review & Store
   ```

2. **Candidate Upload**
   ```
   CSV Upload -> Data Validation -> Database Storage -> Campaign Assignment
   ```

3. **Interview Process**
   ```
   Start Interview -> Voice Call -> Record Response -> Transcribe -> Analyze -> Score
   ```

4. **Results Processing**
   ```
   Collect Scores -> Generate Report -> Update Dashboard -> Notify Stakeholders
   ```

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure session management

2. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest
   - TLS for data in transit
   - Regular security audits

3. **API Security**
